ðŸ”§ Best practices to always follow

Specific rules for Cursor
Always create styles in a separate file named after the file it's linked to
Always create files in incremental steps to avoid token limits
Divide code generation into several separate commands
Recommended implementation structure:
First create the skeleton of the file with imports and basic structure
Add the main classes/functions without their detailed implementation
Implement methods/functions one by one
Finalize with comments and documentation
For PHP files:
Start with the <?php declaration and imports/requires
Add class/function definitions
Implement business logic
Add HTML code if necessary
For HTML/CSS/JS files:
First create the basic HTML structure
Add essential CSS styles
Implement JavaScript by functionality
Always ask for confirmation Before moving on to the next step,
Validate each section before continuing.
Next, create a separate CSS file containing the associated styles.
Then, create a separate JS file with the necessary scripts.
